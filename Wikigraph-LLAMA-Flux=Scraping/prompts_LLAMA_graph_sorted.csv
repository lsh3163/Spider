Here's a new prompt for image generation of the Common Tern:

**Prompt:**

Generate an image of a Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) in a natural environment.

**Description:**

The Common Tern is a medium-sized seabird with a slender body, measuring approximately 33-36 cm (13-14 in) in length. Its plumage is predominantly gray and white, with a black cap on its head, a white forehead, and a distinctive black stripe running from its beak to its eyes. The bill is orange-red with a black tip.

**Environment:**

Depict the Common Tern in a coastal or near-coastal setting, such as a beach, rocky shoreline, or a sandbar. The background should feature a calm, serene atmosphere with a clear blue sky or light, feathery clouds. Incorporate some natural elements like seaweed-covered rocks, driftwood, or sparse beach vegetation.

**Action/pose:**

Show the Common Tern standing or walking on the ground, with its wings slightly folded or held out to the sides. It could be gazing out towards the sea, or looking down at the ground as if searching for food.

**Lighting:**

The lighting should be soft and natural, with the sun positioned at a moderate angle to create gentle shadows and highlights on the bird's feathers and the surrounding environment.

**Composition:**

The Common Tern should be the central subject, with a clear view of its body and face. Leave some negative space around the bird to create a sense of depth and context. Consider placing the tern near the edge of the frame, with the coastline or sea stretching out into the distance.

**Style:**

Aim for a realistic, detailed image with a focus on capturing the bird's textures, feathers, and subtle color nuances. The overall mood should be peaceful and serene, evoking a sense of connection with nature.

**Additional tips:**

* Pay attention to the tern's distinctive black cap and forehead, as well as the orange-red bill with a black tip.
* Include some subtle details like the bird's eyes, nostrils, and the texture of its feathers.
* Consider adding some water droplets or sand particles around the tern's feet to hint at its coastal habitat.

""Generate an image of a group of humans, dressed in futuristic, high-tech, and heavily-insulated space suits, standing on the surface of the planet Venus. The atmosphere is thick with sulfuric acid clouds, and the sky is a deep, fiery orange due to the extreme greenhouse effect. 

The humans are clustered around a large, unfinished snowman, constructed from large, perfectly spherical 'snowballs' that are a deep shade of iridescent blue, due to the unique properties of Venusian 'snow' (which is actually comprised of compressed carbon dioxide and other frozen gases). The snowman is roughly 10-15 feet tall, and has a wide, stable base that prevents it from toppling over in the intense winds.

Each human is engaged in a different task: one is carefully rolling a new snowball, using a high-tech, gravitational-compensating device to manipulate the heavy, dense material; another is adding a carrot nose and coal eyes to the snowman's face, using a specialized, acid-resistant adhesive; a third is holding a strange, glowing 'carrot' (made from a genetically-engineered, luminescent plant species) that is being used to add a touch of color to the snowman's face.

The suits worn by the humans are a vibrant, electric blue color, and are adorned with a variety of tools, pouches, and other equipment. Each suit has a distinctive, glowing 'V' emblem on the chest, representing the 'Venusian Terraforming Initiative'.

In the background, the terrain stretches out in a seemingly-endless expanse of volcanic rock and twisted, blackened tree-like formations, which are actually the fossilized remains of ancient Venusian microorganisms. The air is thick with noxious fumes and ash, and the ground is slick with a thin layer of hydrochloric acid.

The entire scene is bathed in a deep, fiery light, as if the very sky itself is aflame. The snowman, despite being made of frozen gases, seems to glow with an otherworldly, icy light, as if it is a beacon of hope in this hostile, alien environment.""

**Prompt:**

""Generate an image of a lone, stunned, and disheveled human astronaut, suspended in mid-air, surrounded by a swirling vortex of distorted space-time, with the event horizon of a supermassive black hole looming in the background. The astronaut is clothed in a tattered and worn-out spacesuit, with tubes and wires partially detached, and their helmet's visor is cracked and foggy. The face is pale, with a mix of fear, confusion, and determination.

The surrounding environment is a mesmerizing whirlpool of colors, with gravitational waves rippling and bending the light around the astronaut. The event horizon, a shimmering, iridescent disk, appears to be pulling the astronaut in, with tendrils of distorted space-time reaching out like ghostly fingers. The black hole's gravity is warping the astronaut's body, stretching and compressing it in impossible ways.

In the background, the starfield is visible through the distorted space-time, with stars and galaxies twisted and smeared, like paint on a canvas. The image should convey a sense of intense, cosmic chaos, with the astronaut precariously suspended on the cusp of being consumed by the void.

Color palette: Dark blues and purples, with flashes of bright, electric blue and purple, to represent the intense gravitational energy. The astronaut's suit and gear should have a worn, metallic look, with hints of rust and corrosion.

Composition: The astronaut should be centered, with the event horizon looming large in the background. The swirling vortex of space-time should surround the astronaut, with tendrils and waves crashing against their body. The image should have a sense of dynamic movement, as if the astronaut is being pulled inexorably towards the black hole.

Lighting: The image should be lit by the intense, blue-purple glow of the black hole, with flashes of brighter, more intense light emanating from the accretion disk. The astronaut's suit should be illuminated by faint, flickering lights, giving a sense of struggling life support systems.

Style: The image should have a mix of realistic and stylized elements, with a focus on conveying the intense, otherworldly experience of being trapped in a black hole. Think ' космос-horror' meets 'interstellar adventure'.""

This prompt should provide a clear and detailed description of the image, allowing an image generation model to create an accurate and stunning representation of a human surviving a fall into a black hole."
