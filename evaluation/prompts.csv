240,Matthew Boulton   3 September,"Matthew Boulton  (; 3 September 1728 – 17 August 1809) was an English manufacturer and business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt.  In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills.  Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment.Born in Birmingham, he was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31.  By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham.  At Soho, he adopted the latest techniques, branching into silver plate, ormolu and other decorative arts. He became associated with James Watt when Watt's business partner, John Roebuck, was unable to pay a debt to Boulton, who accepted Roebuck's share of Watt's patent as settlement. He then successfully lobbied Parliament to extend Watt's patent for an additional 17 years, enabling the firm to market Watt's steam engine. The firm installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines in Britain and abroad, initially in mines and then in factories.Boulton was a key member of the Lunar Society, a group of Birmingham-area men prominent in the arts, sciences, and theology.  Members included Watt, Erasmus Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood and Joseph Priestley.  The Society met each month near the full moon.  Members of the Society have been given credit for developing concepts and techniques in science, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transport that laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution.Boulton founded the Soho Mint, to which he soon adapted steam power.  He sought to improve the poor state of Britain's coinage, and after several years of effort obtained a contract in 1797 to produce the first British copper coinage in a quarter century.  His ""cartwheel"" pieces were well-designed and difficult to counterfeit, and included the first striking of the large copper British penny, which continued to be coined until decimalisation in 1971.  He retired in 1800, though continuing to run his mint, and died in 1809.  His image appears alongside his partner James Watt on the Bank of England's current Series F £50 note."
241,Quartetto Cetra pronounced kwarˈtetto ˈtʃeːtra Italian,"Quartetto Cetra (pronounced [kwarˈtetto ˈtʃeːtra]; Italian for ""Cithara Quartet"") is an Italian vocal quartet established during the 1940s, active until 1988.The group originated from the previous Quartetto Ritmo following the replacement of one singer. Felice Chiusano filled the vacancy left by Enrico Gentile and joined Tata Giacobetti, Virgilio Savona and Enrico De Angelis in the quartet's line-up. Quartetto Cetra debuted in a radio review titled Riepilogando in 1941.In October 1947, Enrico De Angelis left the group to join the Army. He was replaced by the singer Lucia Mannucci, the wife of Virgilio Savona. That was Cetra's final formation, which lasted for the rest of their four-decade career. The first song they performed together was Dove siete stata nella notte del 3 giugno? (""Where were you on the night of 3 June?"").In 1948, Quartetto Cetra did the dubbing of the choruses for the Italian release of Disney's movie Dumbo. For their excellent job they received a congratulation note signed by Walt Disney himself. Afterwards they did the dubbing for other movies such as Make Mine Music, Melody Time and The Wizard of Oz.Quartetto Cetra made their stage debut in Pietro Garinei & Sandro Giovannini's Gran Baldoria review. Several other musical comedies followed. On stage the Cetras worked with other Italian celebrities of those times, such Wanda Osiris and Alberto Sordi.Italian television was born in 1954. In the same year Quartetto Cetra made their first home television appearance in a show called In quattro si viaggia meglio (""You travel better when you're four""), although they had appeared on British television as far back as 1948 in Café Continental. In time they did a great number of other TV programs. Among them, their parodies of some literature classics such as The Count of Monte Cristo or The Three Musketeers were a huge success.The quartet's early style was very much similar to Mills Brothers's, with jazz and swing vocal arrangements. The group then found its own way with a combination of songs and entertainment: catchy tunes with funny lyrics yet with sophisticated arrangements, performed in comedy acts. The audience loved that, and Quartetto Cetra soon became very popular at first on the radio, then on stage and on the TV as well.Quartetto Cetra was widely credited with the great virtue of combining excellent professional skills with popular entertainment.In over forty years the group's repertoire included more than a thousand songs. Most were written by the duo Tata Giacobetti-Virgilio Savona, two members of the quartet. Just to name a few of them, Il Visconte di Castelfombrone, In un palco della Scala, Un disco dei Platters, Nella vecchia fattoria (Italian version of Old MacDonald Had a Farm), Vecchia America, Che centrattacco (dedicated to Virgilio Levratto), Un bacio a mezzanotte, I ricordi della sera.Quartetto Cetra officially finished their performing career on 1 July 1988 in Bologna, with their last public concert.Their song Crapa Pelada (Testa Pelata) (""Bald head"") is used in the TV series Breaking Bad, in Season 3's final episode, ""Full Measure""."

247,A spar is a type of,"A spar is a type of floating oil platform typically used in very deep waters, and is named for logs used as buoys in shipping that are moored in place vertically.  Spar production platforms have been developed as an alternative to conventional platforms. The deep draft design of spars makes them less affected by wind, wave and currents and allows for both dry tree and subsea production. Spars are most prevalent in the US Gulf of Mexico; however, there are also spars located offshore Malaysia and Norway.A spar platform consists of a large-diameter, single vertical cylinder supporting a deck. The cylinder is weighted at the bottom by a chamber filled with a material that is denser than water (to lower the center of gravity of the platform and provide stability). Additionally, the spar hull is encircled by helical strakes to mitigate the effects of vortex-induced motion. Spars are permanently anchored to the seabed by way of a spread mooring system composed of either a chain-wire-chain or chain-polyester-chain configuration.There are three primary types of spars; the classic spar, truss spar, and cell spar.  The classic spar consists of the cylindrical hull noted above, with heavy ballast tanks located at the bottom of the cylinder.A truss spar has a shorter cylindrical ""hard tank"" than a classic spar and has a truss structure connected to the bottom of the hard tank.  This truss structure consists of four large orthogonal ""leg"" members with X-braces between each of the legs and heave plates at intermediate depths to provide damping. At the bottom of the truss structure, there is a relatively small keel, or soft tank, that houses the heavy ballasting material.  Soft tanks are typically rectangular in shape but have also been round to accommodate specific construction concerns.  The majority of spars are of this type.A third type of spar, the cell spar, has a large central cylinder surrounded by smaller cylinders of alternating lengths.  At the bottom of the longer cylinders is the soft tank housing the heavy ballasting material, similar to a truss spar.

He was the Secretary of the People's National Party (PNP) up to its decision to merge into the Party of National Unity (PANU) on 5 March 2006.  This merger, an affair complicated by several about-turns, saw Bogileka appointed Secretary of the new PANU.  (Bogileka had originally helped to forge the PNP as a union of a former PANU and another party, the Protector of Fiji (BKV); both parties were reregistered in January 2006, seceding from the PNP; the PNP and the BKV subsequently merged into PANU in March).First elected as a candidate of the original PANU to represent the Ba West Fijian communal constituency in the House of Representatives in the parliamentary election of 1999, Bogileka subsequently served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry from 1999 to 2000, and was held as a hostage by gunmen led by George Speight, who led a coup d'état against the Chaudhry government, starting on 19 May 2000.  Political realignments that followed the 2000 crisis saw him lose his seat in the election held to restore democracy in 2001.Bogileka also stirred controversy by criticizing the legacy of modern Fiji's first statesman, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, who is regarded as a national hero.  On 23 May 2005, he said that Sukuna's achievements had been overstated, and that his policies had confined Fijians to villages and marginalized them economically.  He considered that Sukuna should have used his chiefly position to urge indigenous Fijians to work rather than remain in their villages in the name of culture.  His comments provoked an angry reaction from the government, which issued a press release calling his statement ""inaccurate"" and saying that it should be ""treated with the contempt it deserves.""Bogileka has also served General Secretary of the Viti and Resource Landowners Association, which advocates the return to indigenous ownership of all ""crown land"" - i.e., government-owned land.  This was not a political demand, he told the Fiji Sun on 3 January 2006, but rather an insistence on the fulfillment of a promise made by Queen Victoria in 1881, at Nailaga in Ba Province.  He strongly disagreed with Military Commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama for saying that the association should not ""waste time"" trying to recover ownership of the Queen Elizabeth Barracks in Delainabua, Suva.It was announced on 12 March 2006 that Bogileka would contest his old Ba West constituency in the parliamentary election scheduled for 6–13 May.

Boorman's year of birth is an estimate based on evidence found by Haygarth that he was 53 when he died and Haygarth made a comment that Boorman ""began playing in great matches very young"".

He was in a team formed by Sir Horatio Mann, playing against John Sackville's Five, and scored eight runs in the match which Sackville's team won by four wickets. A few weeks later, Boorman made his first known appearance in an important match when he played for Mann's Bourne team against Henry Rowett's Caterham on Westerham Common. One of the earliest scorecards has survived and records that Boorman scored one and nine, but Caterham won by 14 runs.Boorman played mostly for Kent, but he also made appearances for All-England teams. He played for Middlesex as a given man against Essex in the earliest known match on Lord's Old Ground in May 1787, top scoring for the home side in both innings with 23 and 37. He also took a known six (i.e., bowled only) wickets in the match which Middlesex won by 93 runs. From 1791 to 1793, Boorman made six known appearances for Essex and Haygarth suggested that he might have removed into the county, but with no certainty."

361,In electronics and signal processing a,"In electronics and signal processing, a Gaussian filter is a filter whose impulse response is a Gaussian function (or an approximation to it, since a true Gaussian response is physically unrealizable). Gaussian filters have the properties of having no overshoot to a step function input while minimizing the rise and fall time. This behavior is closely connected to the fact that the Gaussian filter has the minimum possible group delay. It is considered the ideal time domain filter, just as the sinc is the ideal frequency domain filter.  These properties are important in areas such as oscilloscopes and digital telecommunication systems.Mathematically, a Gaussian filter modifies the input signal by convolution with a Gaussian function; this transformation is also known as the Weierstrass transform."

381,La valse poème chorégraphique pour orchestre,"La valse, poème chorégraphique pour orchestre (a choreographic poem for orchestra), is a work written by Maurice Ravel between February 1919 and 1920; it was first performed on 12 December 1920 in Paris. It was conceived as a ballet but is now more often heard as a concert work. The work has been described as a tribute to the waltz, and the composer George Benjamin, in his analysis of La valse, summarized the ethos of the work:Whether or not it was intended as a metaphor for the predicament of European civilization in the aftermath of the Great War, its one-movement design plots the birth, decay and destruction of a musical genre: the waltz.Ravel himself, however, denied that it is a reflection of post-World War I Europe, saying:While some discover an attempt at parody, indeed caricature, others categorically see a tragic allusion in it – the end of the Second Empire, the situation in Vienna after the war, etc... This dance may seem tragic, like any other emotion... pushed to the extreme. But one should only see in it what the music expresses: an ascending progression of sonority, to which the stage comes along to add light and movement.He also commented, in 1922, that ""It doesn't have anything to do with the present situation in Vienna, and it also doesn't have any symbolic meaning in that regard. In the course of La Valse, I did not envision a dance of death or a struggle between life and death. (The year of the choreographic setting, 1855, repudiates such an assumption.)""In his tribute to Ravel after the composer's death in 1937, Paul Landormy described the work as follows:...the most unexpected of the compositions of Ravel, revealing to us heretofore unexpected depths of Romanticism, power, vigor, and rapture in this musician whose expression is usually limited to the manifestations of an essentially classical genius."
382,The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras,"The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras is an oil painting on canvas from 1875, painted by Elizabeth Thompson (she became better known as Lady Butler after her marriage to William Butler in 1877). The painting is 97.2 centimeters (38.3 in) high and 216.2 centimeters (85.1 in) wide. It is in the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia.Thompson based the painting on the account of the battle in a book written by Captain William Siborne, the History of the War in France and Belgium in 1815, first published in 1844. The painting portrays the 28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot, of the British Army, on 16 June 1815, at the Battle of Quatre Bras. The battle, part of the Waterloo Campaign of the Hundred Days, was just two days prior to the Battle of Waterloo. The regiment held off attacks from French cavalry at Quatre Bras. Thompson shows the regiment formed in a square in a field of rye, withstanding attacks, at approximately 17:00, from lancers and cuirassiers led by Marshal Ney.Thompson went to great lengths to create models for her work.  In July 1874, she arranged for 300 soldiers from the Royal Engineers to pose in a reconstruction of the square formation, and to fire their rifles, to recreate the smoky scene.   Several of the soldiers also modelled in Thompson's studio.   Thompson observed horses at Sanger's Circus and the Horse Guards riding school, as models for the French cavalry.  She also arrange for a group of children to trample down a field of rye in Henley-on-Thames, to recreate the setting.She had copies of the historic uniforms made by a government manufacturer in Pimlico.   However, the shako she depicts the regiment wearing is incorrect. Whilst nearly all Regiments of Foot in the British Army had adopted the false fronted Belgic shako since 1812, so the replica uniforms were correct for a standard line regiment, the 28th Regiment continued to wear the older stovepipe shakos during the Hundred Days campaign.  The older headwear can be seen clearly in William Barnes Wollen's painting: 28th Gloucester Regiment at Waterloo.The heavy gold frame bears the inscription ""Egypt"" at the top, and ""Quatre-Bras 1815"" below.The work was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1875, the year after Elizabeth Thompson exhibited her acclaimed The Roll Call.  It was bought by the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia, in 1884."
